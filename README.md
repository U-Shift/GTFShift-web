## About 

**GTFShift** emerged from the necessity to understand how to get an
overview of where bus lanes should be prioritized for a given territory, using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.

It provides several methods to identify road segments where bus lanes should be implemented, 
enabling for a transparent and data-driven decision-making process, suitable to different contexts
and criteria. 

This web app provides a user-friendly interface to explore the functionalities of the R package, 
that can be found at [github.com/U-Shift/GTFShift](https://github.com/U-Shift/GTFShift). Refer to the 
[official documentation](https://u-shift.github.io/GTFShift/index.html) for more details.
